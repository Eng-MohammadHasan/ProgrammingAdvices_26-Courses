    One flag (ios::out) means ‚ÄúI want to rewrite/replace.‚Äù
    Another flag (ios::app) means ‚ÄúI want to keep everything and just add more.‚Äù

    That function is supposed to rewrite the whole file after modifying the vector (removing records).
    If you opened with ios::app, it would just keep adding the updated lines at the end,
    and the old (deleted) records would still remain in the file.

    üëâ So here ios::out (overwrite mode) is correct.
    You only use ios::app when you want to add new data without touching existing content.

    Because after deletion you need to replace the file‚Äôs old content with the updated vector.
    If you use append, the old lines stay in the file and the updated lines just get added at the end
    ‚Äî the deleted record won‚Äôt actually be removed.

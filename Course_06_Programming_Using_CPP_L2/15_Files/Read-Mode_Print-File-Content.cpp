			// 2. Stores them in 'Line' (newline not included).
			// 3. Moves file pointer just after the newline,
			//    so next getline starts at the next line.
			// 4. If it cannot read (EOF or error), it sets failbit.

			// Important:
			// getline returns 'istream&' (a reference to the stream).
			// The stream has a built-in conversion to bool:
			//   true  â†’ last read was successful.
			//   false â†’ last read failed (EOF or error).
			// Thatâ€™s why while(getline(...)) works:
			// the loop runs while reading is successful,
			// and stops automatically when EOF is reached.

## External Libraries

The `mylib` folder is a Git submodule linking to the [MohammadUtils](https://github.com/Eng-MohammadHasan/MohammadUtils.git) repository.

It contains reusable C++ utility functions for math, arrays, digits, random numbers, conversions, and console operations, and can be used directly in this course's projects.

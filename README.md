# üõ†Ô∏è Developer Roadmap Journey

This repository documents my **2-year learning roadmap** to become a Full-Stack / Backend / Desktop Developer.  
The roadmap is based on [Programming Advices](https://programmingadvices.com) and includes **26 courses + projects**.  
Focus: 90% practical, 10% theoretical ‚Äî problem solving first, then technology.
